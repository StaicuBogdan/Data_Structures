# Graph Theory and Data Structures

Some combination of C++ and Python programs.

I learned Graph Theory from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/graph-theory-algorithms/">William Fiset's course</a> on Udemy.com, which was really well done.<br>
And I also followed <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-using-C-Zero-To-Mastery/109572333">Harsh Kajla's course</a> about Data Structures on SKillShare.com.

Glad i did both, really intuitive and well explained in depth.
