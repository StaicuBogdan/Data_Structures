# Graph Theory and Data Structures

Some combination of C++ and Python programs.

I learned Graph Theory from William Fiset's course on Udemy.com, which was really well done.<br>
And I also followed Harsh Kajla's course about Data Structures on SKillShare.com.

Glad i did both, really intuitive and well explained in depth.
